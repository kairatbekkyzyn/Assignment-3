            <p>The current capital of Kazakhstan did not arise out of nowhere, but on 
                territory inhabited by man in ancient times. The medieval settlement of Bozok, 
                located five kilometers from Astana, is a thousand-year-old predecessor of 
                the Kazakh capital.</p>

            <p>In the 30s of the XIX century, the city of Akmolinsk appeared in the steppes of 
                Kazakhstan on the site of the village of Akmola. Its population numbered a little 
                over two thousand people. However, over the next 30 years, the city's population 
                tripled. As reported in open sources, Akmolinsk received the status of a city in 1862. 
                It was located on an island in a swampy area, where passage was difficult. In Soviet times, 
                the railway to Kartaly, built in 1931-1936, had a great influence on the economic development 
                of the city.</p>

            <p>A new stage in the life of the city began in the 60s of the twentieth century: in December 
                1960, the city with a hundred thousand people became the center of the virgin lands of northern 
                Kazakhstan. On March 20, 1961, Akmolinsk was renamed Tselinograd as the center of the All-Union 
                development of the North Kazakhstan and South Siberian virgin lands. He was of all-Union importance 
                in providing the country with grain. The city bore this name until 1992. It was in Tselinograd that 
                iconic buildings appeared: the Palace of Tselinnikov - now rebuilt into a "Congress Hall", the Youth 
                House - now the Zhastar Palace, the Ishim Hotel</p>

            <h2>Akmola</h2>
            <img src="images/akmola.jfif" alt="Akmolinsk" class="history-image">
            <p>From 1992 to 1997, the city was called Akmola. On July 6, 1992, the city was renamed according to 
                its historical name - Akmola. According to one version, the name was formed after the area became 
                the center of trade fairs, where a significant number of dairy products (koumiss, shubat, and so on) 
                were sold, which gave the name of the area the meaning of "white abundance".
                On July 6, 1994, a resolution of the Supreme Council of Kazakhstan was adopted on the transfer of the 
                capital from Almaty to Akmola. The international presentation of Akmola as the new capital took place 
                on June 10, 1998.</p>

            <img src="images/ast7.jfif" alt="Modern City" class="history-image">
            <p>On May 6, 1998, by decree of the President of Kazakhstan, the city of Akmola was renamed the city of Astana. 
                Astana is translated from Kazakh as "capital". After gaining the capital status, the city became the second 
                largest in Kazakhstan, and many modern architectural and urban planning projects are being implemented in it. 
                The population increased from 270 thousand people in 1996 to 700 thousand in 2011, and the city's territory was 
                significantly expanded to an area of more than 700 square kilometers due to the construction of a new administrative 
                and business center and other neighborhoods nearby. The city achieved millionaire status in June 2017.</p>
